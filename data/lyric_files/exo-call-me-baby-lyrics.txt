Korean

이 거리는 완전 난리야
사람들 사이는 남이야
함께하는 매 순간이
Like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
What up

Hey Girl 영원 같던 찰나
(운명 같은 순간)
나를 한 순간 뚫고가
(번개처럼 이 세계를)
넌 내 이름 불러주며 나에게로 다가와

놀라워 섬광처럼 가득 차
너를 마주한 순간 oh my
편하게 여기 앉아 이제 내 얘기를 들어봐

Oh I don’t care 나 멀리멀리 돌아간대도
이렇게 너의 곁에
단 한 남자가 되어줄 테니

메마른 내 입술에 너
스며들어와 나를 깨워
The time’s wasting girl
So don’t wait, don’t wait too long

빛나는 것들은 많아
그 안에 진짜를 봐봐
Call me baby, Call me baby
Call me baby, Call me baby
(You know my name girl)
널 향해 커져간 마음아
너 말곤 그 문을 닫아
(You know I’m here girl)
Call me baby, Call me baby
Call me baby, Call me baby
몇 번이라도 Call me girl

나를 나로 존재하게 해
내 세상은 오직 you’re the one
You’re the one
Girl you’re the one I want

빛나는 것들은 많아
그 안에 진짜를 봐봐

Call me baby, Call me baby
Call me baby, Call me baby
몇 번이라도 Call me girl

Baby girl 욕심들 속에 날 선
그 어떤 말도 넘어설
그런 믿음을 보여준 너

모두 변해 날 떠나간대도
너는 나만의 lady
내 손을 잡아주는 그거면 돼

빛나는 것들은 많아
그 안에 진짜를 봐봐
Call me baby, Call me baby
Call me baby, Call me baby
(You know my name girl)
널 향해 커져간 마음아
너 말곤 그 문을 닫아
(You know I’m here girl)
Call me baby, Call me baby
Call me baby, Call me baby

어둔 미로 속에 갇혔던 Oh 나
(그 어둠 속에서)
날 깨워준 [첸/디오] 네 목소리 들려와
날 다시 태어나게 해
[첸/디오] Yeah!

E-X-O Listen!
Say my name (Louder)
혼란스러운 공간 속 날
이끌어줄 빛이 되고 놓치지
않아준 너라면 (What up)
널 안고 변치 않을게 널 안고
나를 떠나버린 사람들과 마주해
Never don’t mind about a thing
내 가슴속 그 거대한 공백에 널 더해

흔들리는 세상 속에서 (Whoo- Babe)
빛이 돼준 오직 한 사람 바로 너
Girl you’re the one I want
(You’re the one I want)

빛나는 것들은 많아
그 안에 진짜를 봐봐

English Translation

This street is completely crazy
Strangers in between people
Every moment that we’re together
Like boom boom boom boom boom
What up

Hey girl, that one moment felt like eternity
(the fate-like moment)
When you pierced into me in just one moment
(like lightning, in this world)
You called my name and came to me

It’s amazing, like a flash of light
You fill me up the moment I see you, oh my
Sit here comfortably and listen to my story now

Oh I don’t care
Even if I have to go far
I’ll be the one man to be by your side

You seeped into my dry lips
And woke me up
The time’s wasting girl
So don’t wait, don’t wait too long

There are many who shine
But look at what’s real among them
Call me baby, Call me baby
Call me baby, Call me baby
(You know my name girl)
My heart grows bigger for you
And it closes its door for everyone else but you
(You know I’m here girl)
Call me baby, Call me baby, Call me baby, Call me baby
Even if it’s many times, Call me girl

You make me exist as myself
You’re the only one in my world
You’re the one, You’re the one
Girl you’re the one I want

There are many who shine
But look at what’s real among them
Call me baby, Call me baby
Call me baby, Call me baby
(You know my name girl)
Even if it’s many times, Call me girl

Baby girl, even among all the greed
And all the words
You showed that you believe in me

Even if everyone changes and leaves me
You are my lady
All I need is for you to hold my hand

There are many who shine
But look at what’s real among them
Call me baby, Call me baby
Call me baby, Call me baby
(You know my name girl)
My heart grows bigger for you
And it closes its door for everyone else but you
(You know I’m here girl)
Call me baby, Call me baby
Call me baby, Call me baby

I was once trapped in a dark maze
(in the darkness)
But I hear your voice that woke me up
You made me be born again
Yeah

E-X-O Listen!
Say my name (Louder)
If you become my light
And pull me through
This chaotic place (what up)
I’ll hold you and never change
I’ll hold you and face those who left me
Never don’t mind about a thing
You came into the big emptiness in my heart

In this shaking world (whoo babe)
You were the only one who became my light
Girl you’re the one I want
(You’re the one I want)

There are many who shine
But look at what’s real among them
Call me baby, Call me baby
Call me baby, Call me baby
(You know my name girl)

(I’ll be your baby yeah- Ho!)
You make me exist as myself
(You know I’m here girl)
You’re the only one in my world
You’re the one, You’re the one
Girl you’re the one I want
(You’re the one that I want)

There are many who shine
But look at what’s real among them
Call me baby, Call me baby
Call me baby, Call me baby
Even if it’s many times, Call me girl
