Bubble pop, bubble pop
From the beginning to the end, don’t replace me
Or I’d rather meet another person
(Ooh ooh you)
Don’t complain
(Ooh ooh you)
What if I go out late at night to play?
What if I don’t answer my phone?
(Ooh ooh hey)
There ain’t any better than me for you
(Hey boy)
Don’t wish for more of me (ma boy)

Your heart lies are like bubbles
Bubble bubble bubble pop
Bubble bubble pop pop
(Ooh boy)
This about this (hey boy)
What do you see when you look at me? (ma boy)
Your heart lies are like bubbles
Bubble bubble bubble pop
Bubble bubble pop pop

You pretty little words when you smile politely
I don’t call you often (Huh huh)
You and me are doing well hey (Hey hey hey)
Bubble bubble pop pop
(Ooh ooh ooh)
What if I laugh sometimes when I’m depressed?
What if I suddenly don’t like you?
(Ooh ooh ooh)
Why do you keep doing that? You never knew me
(Hey boy) There ain’t any better than me for you
Don’t wish for more of me (ma boy)

Your heart lies are like bubbles
Bubble bubble bubble pop
Bubble bubble pop pop
(Ooh boy)
This about this (hey boy)
What do you see when you look at me? (ma boy)
Your heart lies are like bubbles
Bubble bubble bubble pop
Bubble bubble pop pop

Your heart lies are like bubbles
Bubble bubble bubble pop
Bubble bubble pop pop
There ain’t any better than me for you
Don’t wish for more of me

Your heart lies are like bubbles
Bubble bubble bubble pop
Bubble bubble pop pop
(Ooh boy)
This about this (hey boy)
What do you see when you look at me? (ma boy)
Your heart lies are like bubbles
Bubble bubble bubble pop
Bubble bubble pop pop
