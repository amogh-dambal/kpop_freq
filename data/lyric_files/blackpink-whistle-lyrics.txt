English Translated Lyrics:

[Intro: Jisoo]
Hey, boy

[Hook: Lisa]
Make 'em whistle like a missile bomb bomb
Every time I show up blow up (uh)
Make 'em whistle like a missile bomb bomb
Every time I show up blow up (uh)

[Verse 1: Rosé; Lisa]
(R) You’re so beautiful can’t forget you
Your eyes still make my heart flutter, boom boom
(L) 24/365 I only wanna be with you
During the day and at night
I want you like this, ooh ooh

[Verse 2: Jennie]
Every guy checks me out every day
They all think they can get me
I don’t want a lot of things
I want your heart
Cut out your heart and show me
Confidently, sometimes chic chic
So hot so hot
Make me not know what to do
Softly call out to me
Like a whistle in my ear

[Pre-Chorus: Rosé; JiSoo]
(R) Don’t pass me by
If you can’t forget me either, whoa
(J) My heart for you is fire
My heart is beating so fast
You can hear it closer and closer

[Chorus/Multiple]
Whistle (uh)
Whistle whistle whistle
(can you hear that)
Whistle whistle whistle
Whistle (uh)
Whistle whistle whistle
(can you hear that)
Whistle whistle whistle

[Verse 4: Jennie; JiSoo]
(Jen.) Hold up
Don’t say anything
Just whistle to my heart
That sound makes my heart flutter , boom boom
(Ji.) Thoughts are boring
Feelings are shh
Every day all day
Only stay by my side zoom zoom

[Verse 5: Lisa]
Uh I’m always stylin’
I’m chic but in front of you, I'm darlin’
It’s getting hot like a desert island
The more I get to know you, the more my heart rings
Stop hesitating, come over to me
Boy, it’s checkmate now
I win this game (uh-huh)
I choose you, I’ll hug you harder
Before someone takes you away

[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo; Rosé]
(J) Don’t pass me by
If you can’t forget me either, whoa
(R) My heart for you is fire
My heart is beating so fast
You can hear it closer and closer

[Chorus/Multiple]
Whistle (uh)
Whistle whistle whistle
(can you hear that)
Whistle whistle whistle
Whistle (uh)
Whistle whistle whistle
(can you hear that)
Whistle whistle whistle
This beat got me feelin’ like

[Bridge: Jennie, JiSoo, Rosé]
(Jen.) I hope we won’t just pass by like the wind
(Ji.) No need for many words
(R) Just take me to your side

[Outro: Lisa]
Make 'em whistle like a missile bomb bomb
Every time I show up blow up (uh)
Make 'em whistle like a missile bomb bomb
Every time I show up blow up (uh)
