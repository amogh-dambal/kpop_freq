Hangul

[Intro]
Ayo, GG!
Yeah yeah, 시작해 볼까?
어머! 얘 좀 봐라 얘
무슨 일이 있었길래 머리 잘랐대 어?
어머! 또 얘 좀 보라고
머리부터 발끝까지 스타일이 바뀌었어
왜 그랬대? 궁금해 죽겠네
왜 그랬대? 말해 봐 봐 좀
Hahaha! Hey, let me introduce myself
Here comes trouble, whoo! 따라해
너 잘났어 증말

[Verse 1]
지가 뭔데? 웃겨
너무 콧대 센 거 아니?
나보고 평범하단다 얘 (어)
그 남자 완전 맘에 들었나 봐 말도 안 돼 말도 안 돼
너무 예뻐지고 Sexy해졌어 그 남자 때문이지?
물어볼 뻔했다니까 너 바꾼 화장품이 뭔지

[Verse 2]
사실 나 첨 봤어
상처 입은 야수 같은 깊은 눈
얘기만 해도 어질했다니깐
너 잘났어 증말 잘났어 증말

[Pre-Hook]
Here comes trouble, hey girl listen
너 잘났다 증말 (잘났어)
너 잘났어 증말

[Interlude]
Ayo stop! Let me put it down another way

[Hook]
I got a boy 멋진 I got a boy 착한
I got a boy handsome boy 내 맘 다 가져간
I got a boy 멋진 I got a boy 착한
I got a boy, awesome boy 완전 반했나 봐

[Verse 3]
아 내 왕자님
언제 이 몸을 구하러 와 주실 텐가요?
하얀 꿈처럼
날 품에 안아 올려 날아가 주시겠죠?

[Verse 4]
나 깜짝 멘붕이야
그 사람은 내 민낯이 궁금하대
완전 맘에 들어
못 이긴 척 보여 줘도 괜찮을까?
Oh 절대로 안 되지 (그치 그치)
우리 지킬 건 지키자 (맞지 맞지)
그의 맘을 모두 가질 때까지
이건 절대로 잊어버리지 말라구

[Pre-Hook]
밤을 새도 모잘라 다-다
우리 최고 관심사다-다

[Verse 5]
내 말 들어 봐 그 아이 너네 알지?
좀 어리지만 속은 꽉 찼어
어떨 땐 오빠처럼 듬직하지만
애교를 부릴 땐 넘 예뻐 죽겠어

[Pre-Hook]
너 미쳤어 미쳤어
너 미쳤어 미쳤어

[Verse 6]
난 정말 화가 나 죽겠어
내 남잔 날 여자로 안 보는걸
막연할 땐 어떡하면 내가 좋겠니?
질투라도 나게 해볼까? 속상해 어떡해 나?
말도 안 돼 말도 안 돼

[Interlude]
Don’t stop! Let’s bring it back to 1:40

[Hook]
I got a boy 멋진 I got a boy 착한
I got a boy handsome boy 내 맘 다 가져간
I got a boy 멋진 I got a boy 착한
I got a boy awesome boy 완전 반했나 봐

[Bridge]
언제나 내 곁엔 내 편이 돼 주고
귀 기울여 주는 너 너
난 이대로 지금 행복해
잘 될 거니까

[Hook]
I got a boy 멋진 I got a boy 착한 (아 내 왕자님)
I got a boy handsome boy 내 맘 다 가져간
(언제 이 몸을 구하러 와 주실 텐가요?)
I got a boy 멋진 I got a boy 착한 (하얀 꿈처럼)
I got a boy awesome boy 완전 반했나 봐
(날 품에 안아 올려 날아가 주시겠죠?)
I got a boy 멋진 I got a boy 착한
I got a boy handsome boy 내 맘 다 가져간
I got a boy 멋진 I got a boy 착한
I got a boy awesome boy 완전 반했나 봐
I got a boy 멋진

English Translation

[Sooyoung, Yuri, and (All)]
Ayo! GG!
Yeah, yeah, shall we start?
(Uh-muh!) Look at her, look!
What happened to her that she cut her hair? huh?
(Uh-muh!) Again look at her, look!
From head to toe, her style has changed
(Why did she do that?)
I’m curious to death
(Why did she do that?)
Tell me

[Tiffany]
Haha! Let me introduce myself!
Here comes trouble!
Follow after me!

[All, (Taeyeon), and Jessica]
Oh, oh, oh, eh, oh
(Eh-eh-eh-eh)
Oh, oh, eh oh
You really are something else

[Taeyeon and Seonyun]
Who is she? Ridiculous
Do you know you’re too self-assertive?
She thinks I’m average
Yeah, I guess she really liked him
No way, no way!
She became so pretty and sexy
It’s because of him, right?
I almost asked her what her new makeup was

[Sunny, Jessica, and All]
Truthfully, I’ve seen it for the first time
The deep eyes, like a scarred beast
I was dizzy by just talking to him
You really are something else
You really are something else

[All, (Tiffany), Taeyeon and Sunny]
Oh, (here comes trouble!) oh, oh, eh, oh
(Hey, girl, listen!)
Oh, oh, eh, oh
You really are something else
Oh, oh, oh, eh, oh
Oh, oh, eh, oh
You really are something else

[Tiffany]
Ayo, stop!
Let me put it down another way

[All]
I got a boy, a handsome one
I got a boy, a kind one
I got a boy, handsome boy, who took all my heart
I got a boy, a handsome one
I got a boy, a kind one
I got a boy, awesome boy, I must have really fallen for him

[Taeyon and Sunny]
Ah, my prince
When are you gonna come save me?
Like a white dream
Will you lift me in your arms and fly?

[Yoona and (Hyoyeon)]
I’m, like, surprised, mental collapse
He wants to see my face without makeup
I really like him
Would it be okay to show it to him?
(Oh, never!)
Right, right?
(Let’s keep what needs to be kept)
Right, right!
(Until you take all of his heart
Don’t ever forget this)

[All, Yuri, and Sooyoung]
Oh, oh, oh, eh, oh
Oh, oh, eh, oh
Even if I stay up all night, it’s not enough, everything, everything
Oh, oh, oh, eh, oh
Oh, oh, eh, oh
Our biggest interest, everything, everything

[Seonyun and Tiffany]
Listen to me, you all know him, right?
He’s a bit young but he’s full inside
Sometimes he is as reliable as an oppa
But when he acts charming, he is so cute

[All, (Yoona), and Hyoyeon]
Oh, oh, oh, eh, oh
Oh, oh, eh, oh
(You’re crazy, crazy)
Oh, oh, oh, eh, oh
Oh, oh, eh, oh
You’re crazy, crazy

[Tiffany, Taeyeon, and (Yuri and Sooyoung)]
I’m really angry
My boy doesn’t look at me as a girl
What should I do when I feel hopeless?
Should I make him feel jealous?
I’m so upset! What do I do?
(No way! No way!)

Don’t stop!
